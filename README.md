# cert-date
This is a small Node.js script to retrieve certificate expiration dates for a given list of domains.

## ⚡️ Quick start

First, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager). Version 20 or higher is required.

Then, copy the `hosts.sample` file and rename it to `hosts`, and add the domains you want to get certificates for, one per line.

To start the script, use the following command:
```bash
npm start
```
